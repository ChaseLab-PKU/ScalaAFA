# The server side spawns one thread for each expected connection from
# the client-side, opens and registers the range dedicated for this thread
# (a workspace) from the provided memory.
# Each of the server threads accepts a connection on the dedicated port
# (different for each and every working thread) and waits for it to end up,
# and closes itself.
